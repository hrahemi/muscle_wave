# muscle_wave
This repository is for a python library and a software GUI intended to allow scientist to analyse the spectral properties of the muscle EMG signals.

To run the GUI we suggest that you install ANACONDA (https://anaconda.org)  Python package and run the code in the installed SPYDER environment.

The initial part of the code allows for building the wavelet banks for finding intesities across different frequency bands.
